            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> My name is Jin Woo Kim, Jin is preferred name. I was originally born in South Korea and immigrated to
                United States when I was in 6th grade. I stayed in Hawaii for 17 years. For my college, I studied at
                University of Hawaii at Manoa and earned Bachelor of Arts in Biology. Then I worked in different dental
                office to get an experience and also to see if I would like to commit on dental school. I moved here to
                Seattle a year ago in hopes to apply for dental school, but later realize to pursue of my true passion
                which is in IT business.
                My goal in the future is to apply both my study in dentistry and coding and create an app that help
                underserved community to receive health care in affordable price.</p>
